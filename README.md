# sync-files
sync-files works like cloud syncing.

The capabilities of this program is:
1. syncing from *folder* to *backup*
2. if file in the *folder* exist but not exist in the *backup* then file will be copying.
3. if file in the *backup* exist but not exist in the *folder* (the files has been deleted) then file will delete in the *backup*
4. log program
5. syncing in every 5 minutes

next update:
1. make program similar with cloud sync, program have 2 side checking.


Thanks.
